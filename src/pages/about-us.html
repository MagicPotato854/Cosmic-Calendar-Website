    <h2 class="headers">Who Are We</h2>
    <p class="info tab">
        We are a group of dedicated students from various schools across the Denver area who came together at Warren
        Tech with a shared passion for computers, engineering, and innovation.
        Our diverse backgrounds and skill levels make us a unique team, united by our eagerness to learn and grow in
        this ever-evolving field.
        Together, we decided to join the HUNCH program as an opportunity to challenge ourselves, collaborate on
        meaningful projects, and showcase our abilities.
        While some of us are just beginning to explore software development and learning new programming languages, we
        are driven by curiosity, perseverance, and a commitment to contributing to something greater.
        Through HUNCH, we aim to push our boundaries, enhance our technical skills, and make an impact through teamwork
        and creative problem-solving.
    </p>

    <h2 class="headers">Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="info tab">
        Our mission is to design an accurate and seamless system for translating Earth-based time into planetary
        calendars.
        This innovative solution will address the challenges of synchronizing time across different planetary systems,
        enabling more effective interplanetary exploration and communication.
        By developing a reliable platform, we aim to empower astronauts, scientists, and space agencies to coordinate
        operations, share data, and collaborate with ease, regardless of their location in the solar system.
        Our work will play a vital role in supporting humanity's next steps into space, ensuring timekeeping is no
        longer a barrier to discovery and progress.

                I am a Sophomore at Warren Tech and Senior at Green Mountain High School. Early in high school, I
                learned about coding from electives and made it a hobby. I self taught what I wanted to know beyond
                my classes. I learned Python, HTML, JS, CSS, C++, and TI-Basic. And ever since I learned of it, I had a
                passion for space. And I love using math and logic to solve problems, so it is no wonder I chose
                this project.

                Hello there! My name is Alex Luong, and I am eager to display my skills. I am from the Denver Metro
                Area, where my parents came from Vietnam. In school, I have always had a brain for Math, as well as
                Chemistry, hopefully being able to use those traits outside of school. I spend most of my time
                playing videos games. I also exercise a lot, playing various sports and hitting the gym 4-5 times a
                week.
                Beyond gaming and fitness, I love exploring the world of computer science, from problem-solving with
                code to understanding how
                technology shapes our lives. Whether it's optimizing strategies in Valorant or debugging a tricky
                program, I enjoy
                challenges that push meto think critically.I'm excited to see where my skills and passions take me
                next!

                I am a senior in High School. Once I graduate, I plan on going to college to study computer science.
                I strive to lead others to success, and try to maintain a positive attitude through difficult times.
                Outside of school, I enjoy biking, board games, video games, playing piano, spending time with my
                family, and listening to music. As the leader of this project I work hard to ensure the quality of
                our product and create a comfortable working environment for everyone involved.

                I really enjoy programming. I have ever since I learned it existed. I am also interested in reading and
                writing, especially the fantasy genre. I plan to go into a career of software development and plan to go
                to Georgia tech for college in the computer science course.
                I also want to make a game at some point, probably using the Roblox engine, but I could also use the
                Unity engine. I would like to make money off of it because, well, that would be pretty cool. I am
                interested in learning low level programming languages like C and Rust as manipulating the computer
                with that amount of control is seems extremely interesting to me.
