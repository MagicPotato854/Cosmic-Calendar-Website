    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p class="info">
        We are a group of students around the Denver area schools that met at Warren Tech to pursue a
        greater understanding of computers and engineering. Together, we all decided to join HUNCH as a way to show what
        we can do, even if some of us may be new to all of the software and new languages.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="info">
        Our mission is to innovate and develop a seamless, accurate system for translating
        Earth-based time into planetary calendars, empowering future interplanetary exploration and communication by
        creating an efficient platform for communication.
